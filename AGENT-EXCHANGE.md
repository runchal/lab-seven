# Agent Exchange Log (Template v2.0)

## Purpose
Shared architecture decision record (ADR) for every Codex ‚Üî Claude collaboration cycle. Each entry captures reproducibility data, consensus checkpoints, implementation scope, and verification so future contributors can replay decisions without dredging chat logs.

## Role Definitions
- **Primary Agent** ‚Äì Implements code for the current request. Either Codex or Claude can serve as primary per entry.
- **Secondary Agent** ‚Äì Provides analysis, tests, and reviews. Advises the primary and maintains guardrails.
- **User / Requester** ‚Äì Defines goals, resolves deadlocks, and signs off on delivery.

Agents may swap roles between entries, but primary status must be explicit in the log.

## Reproducibility Requirements
- Pin the exact model, version/endpoint, temperature/top-p, and toolchain versions used by both agents.
- Record the runtime image (Docker tag, devcontainer hash, or environment snapshot) and any local overrides.
- Store prompts/system modifiers used for planning or implementation alongside the entry (link or file path).

## Guardrails & Allowed Operations
- Maintain a command/tool allowlist per repository (e.g., lint, test, build, git status, format). Reference it from each entry via `allowlist`.
- Prohibit network writes, package upgrades, database migrations, or environment mutations without explicit ‚úÖ user approval.
- Require secret scanning (`gitleaks` or equivalent) and SBOM/Licence checks before merge.

## Branching, Locks, & File Scope
- Create a dedicated branch per entry: `agent/<primary>/<ticket-or-slug>`.
- Declare `files_write_scope` to reserve file globs for the primary. Secondary agents must not edit outside the declared scope.
- Register any conflicting locks in the log so parallel work can re-sequence safely.

## Workflow Loop
1. **Log Request** ‚Äì Open an entry (status `drafting`) with YAML front matter and initial constraints.
2. **Secondary Proposal** ‚Äì Secondary agent defines approach, assumptions, acceptance criteria, and a failing/regression test to start from.
3. **Primary Response** ‚Äì Primary evaluates the plan, adds concerns, and confirms test strategy (begin by implementing/adjusting the failing test).
4. **Consensus Check** ‚Äì Iterate proposal/response up to two cycles. If still ‚ùå Blocked, escalate to the user with a pros/cons summary.
5. **Implementation & Verification** ‚Äì Primary commits changes under the scoped branch, runs `./scripts/validate-write-scope.sh <entry-id>`, and references tests, CI runs, and diff links. Secondary reviews the diff (not full files) and runs any additional checks.
6. **User Decision** ‚Äì User records approval, overrides, or follow-up tasks. CI (lint/type/unit/e2e/secret-scan/license/sbom) must be green unless `[HOTFIX]`.

## Status, Priority & Metadata Values
- **Status**: `drafting`, `proposal-pending`, `in-progress`, `review`, `approved`, `deferred`, `rejected`, `stale`, `timebox-exceeded`
- **Priority**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `blocking`
- **Scope**: `single-file`, `component`, `architecture`
- **Code Location**: `main`, `prototype/<folder>`, `hotfix`
- **Agreement Level**: ‚úÖ Agreed | ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable with caveats | ‚ùå Blocked

## Entry Structure
Each entry begins with YAML front matter followed by the narrative sections.

  tools:
    - node@20.11.1

assumptions:
  - No third-party fonts may be bundled without legal clearance.

---

## Request
- Summary: Integrate the latest Figma hero export into the prototype while keeping current animation timings.
- Constraints: No production release; maintain existing typography tokens.
- Assets / Links: `figma-exports/hero-refresh.zip`, Figma file link.

## Secondary Proposal
- Approach: Diff export against prototype, reuse existing CSS variables, and generate a regression Playwright test capturing hero layout.
- Assumptions: Export contains HTML/CSS only; no new JS dependencies.
- Test Plan: Add failing Playwright spec `prototype/tests/hero-layout.spec.ts`.
- Open Questions: Do we adopt marketing copy v3 or stay with v2?

## Primary Response
- Assessment: ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns
- Feedback: Export bundles custom fonts; licensing unresolved. Prefer rebuilding with utility classes.
- Alternative: Implement layout with existing utility classes; document copy decisions separately.
- Test Execution: Added test in red; confirms layout mismatch vs. baseline.

## Consensus
- Agreement Level: ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable with caveats
- Trade-offs & Risks: Longer dev time to re-map classes; typography risk mitigated by utility usage.
- Recommended Path: Rebuild hero using utility classes, obtain copy confirmation pre-merge, keep fonts untouched.
- Guardrail Checklist: security ‚úÖ | accessibility ‚ö†Ô∏è (requires screen-reader test) | performance ‚úÖ | localization ‚ö†Ô∏è (await translation check)

## Implementation & Evidence
- Branch: `agent/claude/hero-refresh`
- Diff Review: PR #452 (`git show --stat`)
- Files Affected: `prototype/hero/index.html`, `prototype/styles/hero.css`
- Tests Added/Updated: `prototype/tests/hero-layout.spec.ts`
- CI Status: lint ‚úÖ | unit ‚úÖ | e2e ‚úÖ | secret-scan ‚úÖ | sbom ‚úÖ | license ‚úÖ
- SBOM / Reports: `artifacts/sbom-2025-01-15.json`, `artifacts/gitleaks-report.txt`

## User Decision
- Decision: Approved
- Notes: Marketing copy to be revisited once legal approves fonts.
- Follow-ups: Create entry for production integration after prototype sign-off.

## Notes
- Related Docs: TODO.md line 42, history.md 2025-01-14, ADR-005
- Supersedes: n/a
- Missed Scenario Review: dynamic range checks validated against CMS variants
- Conflicts: Entry AEX-009 (prototype animation audit)
- Prompt Archive: `prompts/2025-01-15-hero-refresh/`

## Rollback Plan
- Summary: Revert PR #452, purge prototype layout cache, re-run Playwright suite.
- Owners: @claude executes revert; @codex verifies tests.
- Verification After Rollback: `pnpm test --filter hero`, manual visual check at 1440px.
```

## Usage Notes
- Append new entries directly below the marker in reverse chronological order.
- Store prompt files referenced in **Prompt Archive** under version control for replayability.
- Secondary agent must produce acceptance criteria and failing tests before primary begins implementation.
- Reviews occur on diffs only (`git diff`, PR view); avoid full-file rewrites unless justified in the log.
- Mark entry `stale` after 14 days of inactivity; revisit during weekly triage to close or re-timebox.
- Update `status`/`priority`/`scope` fields in the front matter as the work progresses.
- Log each proposal/response pass under `consensus_cycles` with timestamps for traceability.
- Run `./scripts/validate-write-scope.sh <entry-id>` before requesting review to confirm no files escape the declared scope.
- Capture verification screenshots with `./scripts/capture-doc-screens.sh` (requires `npx capture-website`) and attach paths under **Implementation & Evidence** when visual changes are involved.
- Document outcomes of the Dynamic Range and Guardrail checklists (security, accessibility, performance, localization) before requesting user approval.

## Edge Cases & Protocols
- **Disagreement Resolution**: After two unresolved cycles, escalate to the user with a comparative table of options.
- **Emergency / Hotfix**: Execute immediately, set `ci_backfill_deadline`, record `[HOTFIX]` in the title, and backfill CI artifacts within 24 hours (log results in a follow-up entry if needed).
- **Implementation Drift**: Primary creating new scope must open a follow-up entry referencing the original.
- **Security & Secrets**: Never touch `.env*` or secrets storage. Run `gitleaks detect --no-git --staged` (or configured scanner) on every branch before requesting approval.
- **Prototype to Production**: Log a second entry for migration, populate `migrates_from`, and link entries via **Supersedes**.
- **Timebox Enforcement**: If `timebox_hours` expires, update status to `timebox-exceeded`, halt work, and obtain user direction before resuming.

## Archival & Indexing
- Archive entries older than 90 days into `AGENT-EXCHANGE-ARCHIVE.md`, grouped by subsystem (e.g., `web/hero`, `api/auth`).
- Link archived entries to formal ADRs when the decision impacts long-term architecture.
